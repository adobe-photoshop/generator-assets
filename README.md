## Image Asset Generation Plug-in for Generator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adobe-photoshop/generator-assets.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adobe-photoshop/generator-assets)

This repository contains a plug-in for Adobe Photoshop CC's Generator extensibility layer. This plug-in makes it easier for users to export image assets from their Photoshop files. Users simply enable image asset generation for a document and name layers (or layer groups, or smart objects) they want exported using a filename-like syntax. Generator then watches these layers, and any time they change, automatically updates the corresponding assets on disk.

To learn more about Generator and creating your own Generator plug-ins, please visit the [Generator Core repo](https://github.com/adobe-photoshop/generator-core).

### Usage
